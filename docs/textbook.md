# Software
This class will be using Unity3D 2018 for its default Dev Env. If you wish this for your personal laptop, and don't already have it installed, you can obtain it for free (under personal use license) from its homepage. Instructions for downloading and installing the software are available on Canvas.


# Storage Media or Source Repo
If you do not already have a USB flash drive for storing and backing up personal files, invest in one!  USB flash drives are available for purchase all over these days, and you can get a lot of storage for pretty reasonable prices!

Otherwise, you may want to learn how to use online/local source code repository toolkits (e.g., unity cloud, git) and keep your codes backed up.
