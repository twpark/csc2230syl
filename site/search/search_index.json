If you miss a class without a prior notice , you will lose 10 points. If you are late to the class without a prior notice , you will lose 7 points. If your attendance point hits 0 or below, your final grade mark will be automatically E. Prior notices should include: Reason why you cannot make the class or would be late (Notices without an appropriate reason may not be counted) Ideas how you would like to make-up the class Refer to this form to report your being late or absence to your instructors respectfully. Prior notices will be counted if and only if delivered before the class begins using the following media: Canvas message Slack message E-Mail Classroom Policy Notes Academic Integrity The current edition of the SPU Undergraduate Catalog describes the University\u2019s commitment to academic integrity, which is breached by academic dishonesty of various kinds. Among these is turning in another\u2019s work as your own and committing plagiarism, which is the copying of portions of another\u2019s words from a published or electronic source without acknowledgement of that source. The penalty for a breach of academic integrity is a failing grade for the work in question on the first offense and a failing grade for the course as a whole with repeated offenses. Classroom Environment Mutual respect and consideration for others make for an effective classroom environment. By following a few sensible guidelines, we can make the classroom a more comfortable place for all. Be respectful for each other and the instructor. Please turn off your cell phones at the beginning of class, or set them to silent mode, so you don\u2019t disturb our time together. Do NOT use your computer during the class period for anything that is not class-related; that is rude and disrespectful not just to the instructor but to your classmates as well. Eating and drinking in class Food and drink are prohibited in the classroom to protect the equipment. The only exception will be for water bottles, which are to be kept tightly closed when not being used. Always take care of bathroom visits and other personal needs before class begins. ARRIVE ON TIME. The instructor will make every effort to both start and end class on time. Barring unavoidable emergencies, it is expected that students will be in the classroom and ready to go right on time. If you know ahead of time that you need to leave class early, please let the instructor know and sit near the door so as to cause minimal distraction. SPU Closure SPU is closed Monday, January 14 (Martin Luther King Day) and Monday, February 18 (Presidents Day). Class will not meet on these days. Inclement Weather Inclement weather or an emergency may on occasion affect SPU\u2019s schedule. In some cases, classes and campus offices may shut-down entirely; in others there may be a late start or an early closure of the campus. Two campus contacts will always carry the most up-to-date information on the campus schedule: the Emergency Closure Hotline (206-281-2800) and the SPU Home Page. Since weather in the Seattle area can change rapidly, check these sites often for updates. If SPU is open but you are unable to travel to campus due to inclement weather, please let your instructor know as soon as possible. Finally, be sure to check your email for any messages from your instructor regarding class activities. Emergency procedure Note the emergency procedures posted in the classroom (and attached to this syllabus), and our emergency exits. In case of an emergency (fire, earthquake, hazardous material spillage, bomb threat, etc.), the class will evacuate the building and gather in the Alumni parking lot to the south of OMH (or, depending on the emergency, immediately go into lockdown). If evacuating, please stay together as you exit, and be sure to check in with your instructor once you reach the gathering place. Also keep your eyes open for classmates. The \"buddy system\" one learns in elementary school still applies in times of emergency! Disability statement In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, students with specific disabilities that qualify for academic accommodations should contact Disabled Student Services (DSS) in the Center for Learning. DSS in turn will send a Disability Verification Letter to the course instructor indicating what accommodations have been approved. Course Evaluation You are expected to participate in an online evaluation of this course and its instructor in a thoughtful and constructive manner. The evaluation data is used to make improvements in the course, and your feedback is considered when selecting textbooks, designing teaching methods and preparing assignments. Courses are evaluated using the Banner Course Evaluation System. All answers are completely confidential - your name is not stored with your answers in any way. Also, DO NOT send the instructor an \"I filled out the evaluation\" email, as this can endanger your anonymity. Both positive comments and suggestions for improvement are helpful. I will not see any results of the evaluation until after final grades are submitted to the University.","title":"Attendence and Classroom Policies"},{"location":"classroom/#attendance-policy","text":"Your attendance will affect your grades directly.

They\u2019ll be posted on Canvas as PDFs along with any necessary files or starter code. You may discuss/study with others on the homework, but every assignment MUST BE INDIVIDUAL WORK . Do not share code with others! Submission and Late Policy The following procedures apply to all assignments (unless specifically directed otherwise). All assignments must be submitted via Canvas to be accepted . Each assignment will have a specified due date. Emailed assignments are not accepted. Assignments not turned in when they are due are considered late. Late assignments will receive a penalty depending on the number of days delayed: -10% for less than 1 day -20% for less than 2 days -30% for less than 3 days -40% for less than 1 week -50% for more than 1 week Late submissions will NOT be accepted after Friday, March 15. Technical Challenge and Late Submission Friendly Reminder: BE SURE TO ALWAYS BACK-UP YOUR WORK and store incremental copies in multiple places. Flash drives and personal laptops only fail just prior to the due date of programming assignments (or so it seems). The instructor is very unlikely to perceive a storage or system crash as adequate grounds for allowing an extension of a due date! Quizzes Each Friday there will be a quiz in the last 20 minutes of class. Doing the homework assignments diligently and paying attention in class will be sufficient to score 100%. The final exam will be composed of 3 individual quizzes to be completed during the final exam time. The lowest 2 quiz grades will be dropped. General Assignment Policy All works are individual : Unless otherwise noted, all work is to be done on an individual basis . At the same time, it is understood that learning from your peers is valid and you are encouraged to talk among yourselves about programming in general and current assignments in particular. Keep in mind, however, that each individual student must do the work in order to learn. Hence, the following guidelines are established: Feel free to discuss any and all programming assignments. Discussion on Slack in the class channel is encouraged, to share common pattern of troubleshooting experiences and to benefit from each other. However, DO NOT allow other students to copy your code. Given that said, DO NOT give any student an electronic or printed copy of any program you write for this class. Gaining the ability to properly analyze common programming errors is an important experience. Do not deprive (too early) a fellow student of his/her opportunity to practice problem solving: control the urge to show them what to do by writing the code for them. If you don't know how to do it wisely, ask the instructor or lab tutors to do it. If you\u2019ve given the assignment a fair effort and still need help, see the lab tutors or instructor. DOUBLE ZERO for plagiarism : If there is any evidence that a program or other written assignment was copied from another student, both students will earn 'double zero' credit for the assignment. That is, zero for the given assignment and another deduction of full credit amount of that assignment. Following the university policy, the act will be automatically reported to department and dean's office. Protect yourself: Handle throw-away program listings carefully. Grading policy Grades will be based on performance in three areas: Area Portion Homework 45% Quizzes 45% Attendance 10% The grading scale is: Range Grade Mark 90% and above A, A- 80% - 89% B+, B, B- 70% - 79% C+, C, C- 60% - 69% D Below 60% E","title":"Assignment and Grading"},{"location":"grading/#assignments","text":"","title":"Assignments"},{"location":"grading/#homework","text":"Weekly assignments due usually every Wednesday evening, typed and submitted electronically .
